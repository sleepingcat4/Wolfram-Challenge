Repository contains code, to solutions for Wolfram Challenges. I started writing code in Wolfram Mathematica Language a few weeks ago. And quickly fell in love with the language
which is why, I thought to create this repository to share my solutions to Wolfram Challenges.

Wolfram Challenges are similar to LeetCode problems but it only being specific to Wolfram Language. **Wolfram Challenge:** https://challenges.wolframcloud.com/

### Filename
Filename is same as the challenge name for easy naviagtion

### Note
The repository is updated weekly, so star & watch the repository for regular updates and solution to new challenges.
